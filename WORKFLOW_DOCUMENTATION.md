## Detailed Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Processing

#### Step 1.1: Data Source Integration
**What was executed:** Multiple data sources were integrated into the system
**Why:** To ensure comprehensive asteroid threat detection using multiple authoritative sources

**Components:**
- **NASA NEO API Client** (`app/nasa_client.py`)
  - Fetches real-time asteroid data from NASA's Near-Earth Object database
  - Processes orbital parameters, physical properties, and threat classifications
  - Handles API rate limiting and error recovery

- **USGS Seismic Data** (`app/usgs_analyzer.py`)
  - Integrates earthquake and seismic activity data
  - Calculates seismic risk for impact scenarios
  - Provides geological context for impact predictions

- **CSV Data Processing** (`scripts/load_to_db.py`)
  - Processes historical asteroid data from CSV files
  - Calculates derived metrics (mass, energy, threat levels)
  - Loads data into the system database

#### Step 1.2: Data Validation & Threat Identification
**What was executed:** Automated threat detection and validation algorithms
**Why:** To identify potentially hazardous asteroids and prioritize monitoring efforts

**Process:**
```python
def validate_and_identify_threats():
    # Calculate distance in Astronomical Units (AU)
    distance_au = asteroid['miss_distance_km'] / 149597870.7
    
    # CRITICAL: Objects within 0.05 AU are potentially hazardous
    if distance_au <= 0.05:
        threat_level = "CRITICAL" if distance_au <= 0.01 else "HIGH"
```

**Results:** System automatically identifies and categorizes threats based on:
- Distance to Earth (≤ 0.05 AU = hazardous)
- Asteroid size and mass
- Velocity and kinetic energy
- Impact probability

### Phase 2: Physics-Based Analysis

#### Step 2.1: Physical Property Calculations
**What was executed:** Comprehensive physics calculations for each asteroid
**Why:** To understand the potential impact energy and effects

**Calculations:**
- **Mass Calculation:** `mass = density × volume` (assuming spherical asteroids)
- **Kinetic Energy:** `KE = 0.5 × mass × velocity²`
- **Impact Effects:** Crater size, destruction radius, seismic effects
- **Energy Classification:** From "Very Small" to "Extinction Level"

#### Step 2.2: Natural Hazard Assessment
**What was executed:** Multi-hazard impact analysis
**Why:** To predict secondary effects and plan comprehensive response strategies

**Hazard Types Analyzed:**
- **Seismic Hazards:** Earthquake magnitude and ground shaking
- **Tsunami Risk:** Ocean impact scenarios and wave propagation
- **Volcanic Triggers:** Impact-induced volcanic activity
- **Atmospheric Effects:** Shockwaves, heat blasts, debris clouds
- **Infrastructure Impact:** Critical facility vulnerability

### Phase 3: Quantum Computing Integration

#### Step 3.1: Quantum Optimization Problem Formulation
**What was executed:** Implementation of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)
**Why:** To solve the complex optimization problem of selecting optimal defense strategies

**Quantum Problem Setup:**
```python
# Defense strategies with costs
DEFENSE_STRATEGIES = {
    "Kinetic": 3,    # Proven technology, moderate cost
    "Nuclear": 8,    # Maximum effectiveness, highest cost
    "Laser": 5,      # Experimental, medium cost
    "Gravity": 2     # Long-term solution, lowest cost
}

# Constraint: Exactly one strategy must be selected
# Objective: Minimize total cost while ensuring effectiveness
```

#### Step 3.2: QAOA Algorithm Implementation
**What was executed:** Quantum circuit construction and optimization
**Why:** To leverage quantum superposition and entanglement for parallel optimization

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend:** Aer Simulator (local quantum simulation)
- **Algorithm:** QAOA with 2 layers (reps=2)
- **Optimizer:** COBYLA classical optimizer
- **Problem Type:** Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)

**Quantum Circuit Structure:**
1. **Initialization:** Prepare quantum states for each defense strategy
2. **Cost Hamiltonian:** Encode strategy costs into quantum operators
3. **Mixing Hamiltonian:** Enable quantum state transitions
4. **Measurement:** Extract optimal solution from quantum state

#### Step 3.3: Classical Fallback System
**What was executed:** Robust fallback mechanism for quantum computation failures
**Why:** To ensure system reliability when quantum resources are unavailable

**Fallback Logic:**
```python
if not self.qiskit_available:
    # Classical optimization fallback
    best_strategy = min(self.DEFENSE_STRATEGIES, key=self.DEFENSE_STRATEGIES.get)
    return classical_solution
```

### Phase 4: API Integration & Response Generation

#### Step 4.1: FastAPI Endpoint Implementation
**What was executed:** RESTful API endpoint for quantum defense optimization
**Why:** To provide accessible interface for quantum-optimized defense recommendations

**Endpoint Specification:**
```
POST /asteroids/{id}/quantum-defense
Parameters:
- mass: Asteroid mass in kg
- velocity: Asteroid velocity in km/s
- time_to_impact: Time to impact in days
```

#### Step 4.2: Response Format & Documentation
**What was executed:** Standardized JSON response with comprehensive metadata
**Why:** To provide actionable results with full transparency

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "asteroid_id": "123",
  "best_strategy": "Gravity",
  "execution_time": "2025-11-02T13:04:34.648004Z",
  "optimization_details": {
    "optimal_value": 2,
    "selected_strategy_cost": 2,
    "quantum_algorithm": "QAOA",
    "backend": "aer_simulator",
    "optimization_successful": true
  },
  "strategy_justification": "Selected Gravity Tractor (cost: 2) - Most cost-effective...",

    "name": "Asteroid Name",
    "input_mass_kg": 1e12,
    "input_velocity_km_s": 20.0,
